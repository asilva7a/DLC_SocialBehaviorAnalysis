    * likely an issue with the user input (i.e. animal id) being partially embedded w/in the string
        * install regex package to help with partial string recognition or find a different solution
    * file sorting at the beginning of the script seems redundant after user input, consider removing
    * not sure why vs code isn't actively tracking changes, should look into it
